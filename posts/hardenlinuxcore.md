## Preamble

This post is about hardening the core components of the Linux kernel.
The article will cover a majority of commonly misconfigured settings in different system files for daily usage of the Linux system. This post will also help with restricting available information that may be valuable to a perpetrator.

---

## Background

The system control file is a file that directly modifies the settings of the running Linux kernel. The sysctl.conf file is designed to override the default kernel values. These values are essential as they change network settings, kernel settings, security settings, limits, and other potentially sensitive or critical settings.

### Disabling Core Dumps

According to Vivek Gite: "Core dumps created for diagnosing and debugging errors in Linux apps. They are also known as memory dump, crash dump, system dump, or ABEND dump. However, core dumps may contain sensitive infoâ€”for example, passwords, user data such as PAN, SSN, or encryption keys. Hence, we must disable them on production Linux servers."

From this, you can infer that the information stored in core dumps may be susceptible if not kept securely or stored. 

To disable core dumps, you will need to add this line in `/etc/security/limits.conf`

```
* hard core 0
* soft core 0
```

Then, in `/etc/sysctl.conf` add the following line:
```
fs.suid_dumpable = 0
kernel.core_pattern=|/bin/false

``` 


### Preventing a Fork Bomb (rabbit virus, wabbit)

A fork bomb is of what follows: `:(){ :|:& };:`. (DO NOT RUN THIS IN A SHELL)

This process continuously creates child processes that infinitely spawn their processes, depleting your system of resources.

A detailed explanation of how fork bombs work is in [this](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-bash-fork-bomb/) article.

To prevent fork bombs, you need to add this line to: `/etc/security/limits.conf`


```bash
<$USER> hard noproc 300
@student hard nproc 50
@faculty soft nproc 100
@pusers hard nproc 200
```

### Systemctl 

The following settings are stored in `/etc/sysctl.conf`


#### Packet Forwarding

```bash
# Controls IP packet forwarding
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
```

#### No Routing

```bash
# Do not accept source routing
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
```

#### SysRQ

```bash
# Controls the System Request debugging functionality of the kernel
kernel.sysrq = 0
```
#### Core Dumps Append PID

```bash
# Controls whether core dumps will append the PID to the core filename
# Useful for debugging multi-threaded applications
kernel.core_uses_pid = 1
```

#### Syn-Flood Protection

```bash
# Controls the use of TCP syncookies
# Turn on SYN-flood protections
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 5
```

#### Disable IPv4 Routing

```bash
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
```

#### Deny Secure Routing (we are not a router)

```bash
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
```


#### We do Not Redirect Traffic

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 0
```

#### Log Impossible Addresses

net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0

```

#### Default Source Route Verification

```bash
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1 
```


#### This is a Host

```bash
net.ipv6.conf.default.router_solicitations = 0
```

#### Accept Router's Preference in Router Advertisements

```bash
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra_rtr_pref = 0
```


#### Learn Prefix in Routers Advertisement

```bash
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra_pinfo = 0
```
