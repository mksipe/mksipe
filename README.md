## Who am I?

Hello! I am Mason and am a cybersecurity student and a casual coder. I don't commit much, but I usually like to experiment with a bunch of different languages, such as Python, Puppet, Rust, and shell. 

## What are my projects?

Currently, I have a few projects that I have created and no partiallymaintain. 

 |Project|Description|
|-|-|
|HTS4|Designed in rust to replace the other versions of the HTS program that I made in shell because it was too slow. It was written in rust and is easily modifyable to look for other tools.|
|DBCrack|This is an attempt at makeing a password cracker that uses rainbotables to look up hashes based upon an input after generating a handful of hashes of a provided wordlist.|
|Shell Script Lib|This was made initially for CyberPatriot as it contained a handful of useful scripts. They aren't as effective or stable now. But they are nice to have in reference of how shell works.|
